# SwampSwap
A Centralized Second-Hand Marketplace for International Students

# The Problem

International students frequently need to buy and sell used items such as furniture, kitchenware, electronics, and vehicles—especially during graduation or relocation periods. However, these transactions currently rely on fragmented WeChat second-hand groups that are created by each cohort and limited to 500 members. This results in low visibility for sellers, missed opportunities for buyers, and an inefficient overall trading experience.

# Our Solution

SwampSwap provides a centralized, campus-focused marketplace where international students can list, discover, and exchange second-hand items in one unified platform. Instead of posting items repeatedly across multiple chat groups, users can upload listings once and make them visible to the entire student community.

On SwampSwap, every user can seamlessly switch between buyer and seller roles, making it easy to both sell used items and find affordable essentials throughout the academic year.

# Key Value

Higher visibility: Listings are accessible to all students, not just one cohort

Better discovery: Buyers can browse and search items anytime

Lower friction: One platform replaces multiple chat groups

Community-driven: Built specifically for international student needs

# Vision

SwampSwap aims to become the default second-hand trading hub for international students, starting on a single campus and expanding to multiple universities. By centralizing supply and demand, the platform reduces waste, saves money, and builds a more sustainable and connected student community.
